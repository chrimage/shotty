# Screenshot MCP Server - Project Brief

## Project Overview

### Executive Summary
The Screenshot MCP Server is a specialized Python-based Model Context Protocol (MCP) server designed to bridge the gap between AI development environments and desktop screenshot capabilities. This greenfield project addresses the critical need for programmatic screen capture functionality within AI-powered development workflows, specifically targeting the GNOME/Wayland desktop environment.

### Business Context
As AI-assisted development tools become increasingly sophisticated, there's a growing demand for AI agents to interact with and understand desktop environments. Current MCP server ecosystem lacks robust, secure screenshot capabilities that can be seamlessly integrated into AI workflows. This project fills that gap by providing a standardized, secure interface for screen capture operations.

### Value Proposition
- **AI-Native Integration**: Purpose-built for AI development environments using MCP protocol
- **Security-First Design**: Implements strict file system constraints and command injection prevention
- **Wayland Compatibility**: Addresses the challenging technical requirements of modern Linux desktops
- **Developer Experience**: Simple, standards-compliant API that integrates seamlessly with existing toolchains

## Market Analysis

### Target Market
**Primary Market**: AI development tool users, particularly those using:
- Claude Code and Claude Desktop
- VS Code with GitHub Copilot
- Cursor IDE
- Continue extension users
- Other MCP-compatible development environments

**Secondary Market**: 
- Custom AI agent developers
- Desktop automation enthusiasts
- Linux/GNOME power users seeking programmatic desktop interaction

### Competitive Landscape
**Current State**: Limited competition in MCP-specific screenshot tools
- Generic screenshot utilities (lacks MCP integration)
- Platform-specific solutions (Windows/macOS focused)
- Complex desktop automation frameworks (over-engineered for simple screenshot needs)

**Differentiation**:
- First-class MCP protocol support
- Lightweight, single-purpose design
- Security-conscious architecture
- GNOME/Wayland specialization

### Market Opportunity
The MCP ecosystem is rapidly expanding with 80+ client applications supporting the protocol. Screenshot functionality is a fundamental need across multiple use cases:
- AI debugging and testing
- Documentation generation
- UI/UX analysis
- Workflow automation
- Visual AI training data collection

## Technical Overview

### Core Architecture
- **Language**: Python 3.10+ with FastMCP framework
- **Communication**: stdio transport for secure local execution
- **File Management**: Constrained to ~/Pictures/Screenshots directory
- **Desktop Integration**: GNOME/Wayland command-line interface

### Key Technical Differentiators
1. **MCP-Native Design**: Built specifically for MCP protocol vs. retrofitted solutions
2. **Security-First**: Implements comprehensive input sanitization and path validation
3. **Wayland Support**: Addresses the challenging technical requirements of modern Linux desktops
4. **Resource Management**: Efficient screenshot storage and retrieval system

### Technical Risks & Mitigation
